            kanban project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of
            what <span class="legal_notice_span">Join</span>

          <h2 class="legal_notice_h2">What is Join?</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="legal_notice_span">Join</span> is a kanban-based
            project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated
            students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer
            Akademie.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
            method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
            efficiency (or flow).
            <span class="legal_notice_span">Join</span> leverages the principles
            of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an
            intuitive, visual interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to note that
            <span class="legal_notice_span">Join</span> is designed as an
            educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business
            usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience,
            we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy,
            or other aspects of quality regarding
            <span class="legal_notice_span">Join</span>.

          <h2 class="legal_notice_h2">How to use it</h2>
          <p>
            Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
            <span class="legal_notice_span">Join</span>:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li class="hp_li">
              <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
              <p>
                When you log in to <span class="legal_notice_span">Join</span>,
                you'll find a default board. This board represents your project
                and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await
                feedback” and "Done".
              </p>
            </li>

            <li class="hp_li">
              <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
              <p>
                In <span class="legal_notice_span">Join</span>, you can add
                contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts"
                section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required
                information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks
                and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li class="hp_li">
              <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
              <p>
                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
                Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
                appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details
                in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,
                etc.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li class="hp_li">
              <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
              <p>
                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect
                that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one
                list to another.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li class="hp_li">
              <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
              <p>
                Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
                list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it
                from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as
                this action is irreversible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember that using
                <span class="legal_notice_span">Join</span> effectively requires
                consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board
                reflects the current state of your project.
              </p>
